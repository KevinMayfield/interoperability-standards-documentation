# Why Common Frameworks?

* Want to deliver the standards which will enable plug-and-play interoperability in the NHS whilst reducing bespoke integrations
* At present, we are often asked by NHS England Programmes to create specifications to solve their narrow use cases leading to a proliferation of bespoke integrations and patterns
* Through repeated work on individual programme requests we are able to identify common patterns and frameworks
* These common frameworks are focused on meeting the needs of business processes rather than being technically focused
* Providing implementors with a common foundational set of patterns and frameworks will reduce development time and cost as well as improve interoperability within the NHS.

# What are Common Frameworks?

* We need to define common frameworks that solve particular areas of interoperability, for example, how to query for patient data
* In order to get to these we have focused first on people e.g. the patient or healthcare professional, then on the clinical or business process, and only then will technology be surfaced e.g. FHIR Structured Data Capture
