Miss Cortana, the administrative staff member working for York Hospital discovered that an unidentified patient who came into A&E is Mrs Smith from Malton. The patient that had been assigned a local ID 22789, had already been created to allow her to be admitted into A&E, as she was unconscious and had no form of identification with her at that time. Miss Cortana needed to merge this patient with Mrs Smith's record and this triggered a A40 message to do this.
