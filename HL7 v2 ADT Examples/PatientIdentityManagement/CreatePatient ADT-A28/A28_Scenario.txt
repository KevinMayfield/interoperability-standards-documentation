Mrs Smith attends the hospital to attend a drop in outpatient clinic recommended by her GP Dr. Townley of the Malton GP Practice. She arrives at the hospital and speaks to the receptionist Miss Cortana at the front desk. As this is the first time she has ever visited York Hospital, Miss Cortana takes the patient's name, address and date of birth and searches on the Personal Demographics Service for her details. This is found and Miss Cortana confirms it is the correct person. As Miss Cortana had previously consented to having a Summary Care Record, her allergy information was recieved from PSIS and this was also added to the record. Once this was saved and Mrs Smith was registered, this triggered a HL7 A28 message.
