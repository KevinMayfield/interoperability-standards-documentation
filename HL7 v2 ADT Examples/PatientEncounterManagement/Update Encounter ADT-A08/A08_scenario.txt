Mrs Fredrica Smith had been admitted to the ENT department of York Hospital having been diagnosed with Streptococcal tonsillitis by Dr Darwin. Upon admission Mrs Smith informed Miss Cortana the receptionist, that she now knew the exact date and time of birth and wished to update the hospital's records. As her mother Helgar had found her original birth certificate, Mrs Smith's demographic record no longer needed to contain an estimated date of birth flag. Miss Cortana confirmed and entered the patient's exact date of birth, and removed the estimated date of birth flag. This triggered a HL7 A08-A01 message to update the patient's encounter information.
