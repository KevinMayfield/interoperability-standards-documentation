Mrs Smith returned to York Hospital for another visit to the clinical oncology department to see Dr Darwin. As part of a series of visits, Mrs Smith was allowed to take a leave of absence to return home to Malton following treatment until her next appointment. Mrs Cortana the receptionist, greeted Mrs Smith as she arrived and marked her in the PAS system as returned from leave of absence, triggering an A22 HL7 message.
