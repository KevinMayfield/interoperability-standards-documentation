Mr Smith had driven Mrs Smith to the maternity ward at York Hospital as she had gone into labour. As there was a lack of staff that day, the attending Doctor Dr Samuels was the only person able to assist in the birth. After her successful delivery the baby was born with no issues and Mrs Smith was declared medically fit and ready for discharge home. Using the specialist maternity systems in the maternity ward, Miss Cortana the receptionist processed her discharge. ADT A03 update master message was sent from the Matenrity system to the PAS system.
