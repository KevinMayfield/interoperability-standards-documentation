The receptionist in the recovery ward Miss Cortana was tasked with updating the bed board using the electronic whiteboard that had recently been installed. She saw that bed 2 where Mrs Smith was according to the system, was now empty and appeared free. Miss Cortana marked the patient as discharged using the electronic whiteboard. However she then realised that Mrs Smith had been transferred to another ward and not actually discharged after asking another member of staff. Using the bedboard Miss Cortana chose the option to undo the discharge. This sent a A13 message to the PAS system to cancel the discharge.
