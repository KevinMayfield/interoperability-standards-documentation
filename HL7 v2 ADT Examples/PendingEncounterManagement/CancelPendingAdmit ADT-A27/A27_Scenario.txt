Mrs Smith following her outpatient appointment was told she should be admitted for further tests. In advance of admitting Mrs Smith, a pending admission was set up in the PAS by Miss Cortana the receptionist, to inform the ward of her arrival so a bed could be prepared. However shortly after this, Mrs Smith decided not want to stay in the hospital further and since Dr Darwin had declared Mrs Smith was medically fit, she did not have to be admitted. Miss Cortana cancelled her previous pending admission triggering a A27 HL7 message.
