Mrs Smith was due to be discharged from recovery ward after her stay in hospital. In advance of moving Mrs Smith, a pending discharge had been set up in the PAS by Miss Cortana the receptionist, to inform the pharmacy. However Dr Darwin the consulting doctor, observed that Mrs Smith may not be discharged on 15th April 2010 1130AM so the pending discharge was cancelled and A25 message is triggered from PAS.
