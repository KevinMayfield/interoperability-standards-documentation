Mrs Smith was due to be transferred to the surgical ward for her interval appendicectomy procedure. In advance of moving Mrs Smith, a pending transfer had been set up in the PAS by Miss Cortana the receptionist, to inform the surgical ward. However Dr Darwin the consulting doctor, observed that Mrs Smith was improving and may not require surgery after all and so the pending transfer was cancelled so that further tests could be carried out.
