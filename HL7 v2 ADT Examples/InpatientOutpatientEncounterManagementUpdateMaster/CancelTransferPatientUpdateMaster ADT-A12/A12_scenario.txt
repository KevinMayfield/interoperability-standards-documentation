Mrs Smith was due to be transferred to the recovery ward following her interval appendicectomy procedure. Just after the procedure had completed as Mrs Smith was being moved, there was a complication and she had to be brought back to the surgical ward. The transfer which had already been recorded on the system had to be cancelled. This was recorded by Dr Darwin, who had performed the procedure, using the surgery and anaesthesia dashboard system used in the theatre to monitor the patient.
