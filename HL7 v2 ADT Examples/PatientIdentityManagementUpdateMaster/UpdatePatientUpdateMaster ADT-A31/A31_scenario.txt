Mrs Smith has been referred for an inpatient appointment by her GP Dr. Townley of the Malton GP Practice. She arrives at York hospital to find a self check in service is being implemented to inform the hospital that she has arrived. Using a self service check in kiosk, she enters her details and is then asked whether she would like to add or change any of her demographic details. Mrs Smith decides to enter some emergency contact information and adds her mother as a next of kin. She also decides that she no longer wants to store a summary care record. Once these changes were entered, the kiosk sends a A31 master update message to the PAS system to update it's records with this new information.
